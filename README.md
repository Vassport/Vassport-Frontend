## Problem Statement

- Our world is seeing more demand than ever before for safe traveling between countries and safer school environment for our kids that need in-class learning, especially in their young ages.
- These needs must be met with safety guidelines and policy in order for everyone involved in this pandemic to safely enjoy their activities and learnings in and outside of their homes.

- There is not yet any useful application that can record one’s vaccination history and be able to store the official vaccination document electronically to verify one’s vaccination status.

- Carrying the vaccination document as paper form can cause individuals to easily lose them, and it will take significant amount of time going over hundreds of people’s vaccination record when, for example, if it was during the hockey game that accommodates at least seventeen-thousand people per game.

## Solution Vision

Mobile application that can be downloadable by any smartphone user and it is able to record one’s vaccination history and be able to generate QR code that can be used as a vaccination verification.

- Vassport is able to accommodate multiple users. This multi-user availability especially useful when kids in their very young age without phones have their vaccination record managed by their parents. And for parents, their accounts are separate from kids and they are able to manage their own accounts with their own vaccination record.
- User can record and track their symptoms regarding post-vaccination side effects. The user’s symptoms data can be sent to doctors for research and development or it can be used as a data for doctors to avoid recommending specific vaccines to individuals with certain symptoms if the user chooses to share the symptoms information.
- Activity log which tracks the location that the user has visited, and that location information is stored as records inside the system. This will be useful for parents that are able to know where their children have visited if the children have their own smartphone. And for any general users, it will help them track their visited locations. For health workers, it will help them know if their patient who has recently had their vaccination has effective immunity rate even in high infectious location.
